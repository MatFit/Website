This website was inspired by the stress inducing pressure of learning HTML/CSS in a matter of days for a class. It was a lab assignment. But considering that the "instructions" of the lab was as analogus to being taught basic character movement in Cat Mario (Im trynna say that it was basically me doing it myself). I believe I deserve full credit. 

Key concepts I've understood: Order of scriptings being imported matters, Html is just certain elements within elements with container classes being almost the foundation, classes and id matter (classes for CSS and id for JS work), and other things

Lesson I learned: Code reusability and being able to read code here is everything and understanding why it is. For so long did I spend so much time learning simple elements or small syntax or whatever. It was so much more efficient to look at websites in general, read it, understand it. Use chunks, modify it, add stuff, etc. No need to just start everythign from scratch waste of time not efficient. Will do for future stuff.
